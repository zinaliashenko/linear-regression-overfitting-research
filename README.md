### Linear Regression and Regularization for Forecasting the Number of Bicycle Rentals

In this task, I studied the relationship between various attributes and the number of bicycles for rent. I considered the phenomenon of overtraining, found out how to diagnose and control overfitting, and studied regularization techniques to avoid overtraining and improve predictions.

### Steps:

**Data Download and Analysis:**
Download the bike rental data “bikes_rent.csv” dataset, which contains calendar information and weather conditions characterizing automated bicycle rental points, as well as the number of rentals on that day, by day.
Construct graphs to explore the relationships between attributes and the number of rentals.

**Linear Dependence:**
Calculate the correlations between the attributes and the number of rentals.
Determine the linear dependencies by evaluating the weights of each attribute.

**Collinearity problem:**
Explore the collinearity problem and solve it using attribute scaling.

**Regularization (Lasso and Ridge):**
Use Lasso and Ridge regression to control overtraining.
Consider attribute weights after regularization.

**Evaluation of Different Regularization Values:**
Explore attribute weights for different values of the regularization parameter.
