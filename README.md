In this task, we will see examples of how linear models are overtrained, we will analyze why this happens, and we will find out how to diagnose and control overfitting.

We will work with the “bikes_rent.csv” dataset, which contains calendar information and weather conditions characterizing automated bicycle rental points, as well as the number of rentals on that day, by day. The latter we will predict; thus, we will solve the regression problem.
